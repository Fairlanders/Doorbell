```
1-A Raspberry Pi or Arduino Uno
2-Two buttons
3-Two 100nF transistors.
4-A solderer and a long cable

## Why do I need capacitors?

You need capacitors to remove noise. With noise, your raspberry pi or arduino will get activated on GPIO pins 18 and 17, but in reality you didn't even touch a button! 

If you want to learn more about noise, here's a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronics)).

## I want to implement it to my house

Just reach me through my personal website, you can contact to me through Steam, Discord or anything like that Idk Lmao.
