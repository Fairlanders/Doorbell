# Doorbell
A smart doorbell which plays random songs. One button is for outsiders to ring the bell, one button is for you to stop the music and transistors are for reducing noise, AKA: ghost button presses.

## Requirements

Things that you need:

```
1-A Raspberry Pi or Arduino Uno
2-Two buttons
3-Two 100nF transistors.
4-A solderer and a long cable
5-Ability to google
```

## Why do I need capacitors?

You need capacitors to remove noise. With noise, your raspberry pi or arduino will get activated on GPIO pins 18 and 17, but in reality you didn't even touch a button! 

If you want to learn more about noise, here's a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronics)).

## I want to implement it to my house
